# 🔧 Fixes Applied - October 15, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Button Placement Fixed
**Problem**: "Enter Sofia's Realm" button was in the top-right corner of the screen, which felt awkward on desktop.

**Solution**: 
- Moved button to a more prominent, centered position
- Now appears **below the "Choose Your Character" title**
- Better visual hierarchy and user flow
- More intuitive placement for primary action

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `app/page.tsx` to pass `onEnterSofiasRealm` prop
- Updated `components/character-select.tsx` to display button centered below title
- Added animation for smooth entry

### 2. ✅ Photo-to-Coloring-Book Conversion
**Problem**: Uploaded images were photos (.jpg) which aren't ideal for coloring - they lack clear outlines and lines.

**Solution**: 
- Added **automatic edge detection** to convert photos to line art
- Implemented Sobel-like filter for outline extraction
- Created toggle to switch between **Outline Mode** (for coloring) and **Photo Mode** (original)

**How It Works**:
1. **Outline Mode** (Default - Eye icon 👁️):
   - Converts images to grayscale
   - Applies edge detection algorithm
   - Creates black outlines on white background
   - Perfect for coloring!

2. **Photo Mode** (Eye-Off icon):
   - Shows original photo
   - Useful for reference or comparison

**Changes Made**:
- Added edge detection algorithm in `components/coloring-canvas.tsx`
- Added `useOutlineMode` state (defaults to `true`)
- Toggle button with Eye/EyeOff icons
- Applied to both initial load and clear operations

## 🎨 How to Use the New Features

    [Character Grid Below]
```

### Outline Mode Toggle
Located in the top-right controls:
```
🏠  |  👁️  📥  💾  ↶  🗑️
      ↑
  Outline Toggle
  
👁️ = Outline Mode (ON)  - Black lines, great for coloring

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Edge Detection Algorithm
```javascript
// Sobel filter for edge detection
- Convert to grayscale
- Apply horizontal gradient (Gx)
- Apply vertical gradient (Gy)  
- Calculate magnitude: √(Gx² + Gy²)
- Threshold: > 50 = edge (black), else white
```

### Performance:
- Edge detection runs only on image load
- Cached in canvas, no runtime overhead
- Toggle instantly switches between modes
- No impact on drawing performance
